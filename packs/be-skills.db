The idea behind this ritual is not to punish the faithful (though some sadistic Cotars take great pleasure in prescribing penance). Rather, by confessing his sins, the adherent allows the Cotar to divine (hence, the name of the ritual) where his soul has lost its way.

The primary faith and doctrine in the Iron Empires is that of the Mundus Humanitas. The principle symbol of the Mundus Humanitas is the burning wheel.

Cotars wear this symbol around their necks or emblazoned on their robes. The Mundus erects the symbol on all of its temples and inscribes it on all of its vessels. The Church\u2019s military insignia features the burning wheel set in front of a sword. The Church understands very well the power of ceremony. It erects enormous temples everywhere it gains a foothold. Sweeping arches, golden altars and burning fires serve to remind the adherent of the power of fate and the spirit. A temple inspires one to never forget the rectitude of the Mundus Humanitas.

Cult Doctrine is the application of a belief system to a non-standard, unapproved or independent school of thought. The Church of the Transition (or, \u201cCHOT,\u201d as it often calls itself) is a pantheistic cult that has taken root in the Darikahn Empire\u2019s southern reaches. The CHOT believes in a series of gods that each has dominion over a particular aspect of creation. There are seasonal gods, rain gods, earth gods, fire gods and others. Each is prayed to for assistance in overcoming the elements, having favorable weather and receiving blessings on the home. They are all governed by a matriarchal deity sometimes referred to as Dana but usually simply as \u201cthe Goddess.\u201d It is called the Church of the Transition because its principal doctrine is that transition is the path of nature.

It can be used to destroy a vehicle or other type of machine, destroy property, reduce positions and destroy fortifications. To destroy something, the character must either have a building scene in which he sets the explosives or use the Demolitions specialist action or Grenades and Bombs actions in Firefight. Hitting a vehicle or character with explosives works just a like a shot opportunity. The obstacle is 2, extra successes from the skill test act as a bonus to the Die of Fate or can be used to hit a specific location. Use the damages for explosives listed in the Weapons heading of Firefight or the rules described in the Munitions skill. Destroying a player\u2019s property is an Ob 3-8 Explosives test (depending on the size of the property) and an Ob 4- 8 Resources test for the materials. The Explosives skill may also be used to reduce a position in Firefight. It requires an Explosives test with an obstacle equal to the position\u2019s value. The character must have explosives on hand during the scene capable of delivering vehicular scale damage. Destroying fortifications is a versus test between the Explosives skill and the Fortifications skill. The character must have explosives capable of delivering vehicular-scale damage before the test is made. Rigging something to blow takes a building scene. An Explosive detonation does damage to characters in the vehicle, property, position or fortification. When in doubt, a big explosion does V4, V7, V10 damage to characters and has the following traits: Blast and Devastator.\nPractice Cycle: 6 ms.
