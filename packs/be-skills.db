Hrs/day: 4r/8d/16c Technology: Yes. D demonology  Per Demonology is a specialized skill  taught  to  the  Inquisitors  of  the  Mundus Humanitas. Using this skill,  a player may correctly identify the  demons  possessing  a  character.  Demons  manifest  in  the  form  of  wrong-thinking, heresy and illness.  Once  a  demon  is  identified,  this  skill also provides the knowledge  necessary to drive it out. Typically,  such  procedures  involve  intense  interrogation and bodily privations.  It is not uncommon for the subject  of such treatment to succumb to the  rigors and pass on to the immortal  fire.  This  skill  may  be  used  as  Torture and Interrogation so long as  the victim is held in isolation by the  Inquisition. Practice Cycle: 6 ms. Hrs/day: 3r/6d/12c Technology: Color. disguise  Per/Agi Disguise  is  the  art  of  changing  one\u2019s  face  or  appearance  to  look  like  another  person  or  ethnicity.  Successful  Disguise  tests  do  two  things:  They  act  as  a  linked  test  with Inconspicuous, and they negate  appearance-based obstacle penalties.  The base obstacle is 1: Each obstacle  penalty reduction is +2 Ob. Set the  obstacle before rolling. Practice Cycle: 3 ms. Hrs/day: 3r/6d/12c Technology: Yes, some sort of  appropriate kit comprised of  prosthetics, cosmetics and clothing. divination  Per One of the prime tasks of the Cotars of  the Mundus Humanitas is to practice  divination upon their parishioners.  Divination requires that the Cotar  hear the faithful\u2019s confession, after  which  he  gazes  into  the  burning  wheel and divines the proper penance  for  the  transgressions.  The  idea  behind this ritual is not to punish the  faithful (though some sadistic Cotars  take great pleasure in prescribing  penance). Rather, by confessing his  sins, the adherent allows the Cotar  to divine (hence, the name of the  ritual) where his soul has lost its way.  Penance purifies the individual, and  the Cotar suggests ways in which the  person can find destiny\u2019s true path.  Releasing  the  burden  of  secrecy  causes the soul to rise, the goal of all  true devotees of the faith.  The Divination skill may be used as  the primary skill in a Duel of Wits  against a penitent. The stakes of the  duel for the cotar must be to change  one of the sinner\u2019s Beliefs. Through  this change the sinner must perform  an act of contrition and thus find his  way. Practice Cycle: 6 ms. Hrs/day: 3r/6d/12c Technology: No. doctrine  Per Doctrine describes the tenets and  beliefs of a particular religious faith.  The primary faith and doctrine in the  Iron Empires is that of the Mundus  Humanitas.  The principle symbol of the Mundus  Humanitas  is  the  burning  wheel.  Much  of  the  Church\u2019s  doctrine  is  embodied in this simple icon: The  consistency and stability of life is the  wheel\u2019s constant turning, and the  divine light of humanity is the flames.  Cotars wear this symbol around their  necks or emblazoned on their robes.  The Mundus erects the symbol on all  of its temples and inscribes it on all  of its vessels. The Church\u2019s military  insignia features the burning wheel  set in front of a sword. The Church understands very well  the  power  of  ceremony.  It  erects  enormous  temples  everywhere  it  gains a foothold. Sweeping arches,  golden altars and burning fires serve  to remind the adherent of the power of  fate and the spirit. A temple inspires  one to never forget the rectitude of  the Mundus Humanitas. A  character  may  only  take  the  following variations of the skill if  they were available on his lifepaths  or through general skill points:  Heretical Doctrine is a set of beliefs  and tenets that are an offshoot of  the  popular  religion  but  are  not  commonly accepted by the religious  power structure. The Cyreans are a  heresy of the Mundus Humanitas.  They do not believe in the primacy of  the Theocracy\u2019s Primarch to dictate  the will of the Prophet. Cult Doctrine is the application of  a belief system to a non-standard,  unapproved or independent school of  thought. The Church of the Transition  (or, \u201cCHOT,\u201d as it often calls itself) is  a pantheistic cult that has taken root  in the Darikahn Empire\u2019s southern  reaches. The  CHOT  believes  in  a  series  of  gods that each has dominion over  a  particular  aspect  of  creation.  There are seasonal gods, rain gods,  earth  gods,  fire  gods  and  others.  Each is prayed to for assistance in  overcoming  the  elements,  having  favorable  weather  and  receiving  blessings  on  the  home.  They  are  all governed by a matriarchal deity  sometimes referred to as Dana but  usually simply as \u201cthe Goddess.\u201d It is called the Church of the Transition  because  its  principal  doctrine  is  that transition is the path of nature.  All things begin as one thing and  transform to another. Practice Cycle: 6 ms. Hrs/day: 3r/6d/12c Technology: No. driving  Per/Agi Driving encompasses the operation of  ground-based vehicles\u2014cars, trucks,  ground-effect hovercraft and other  similar machines. While most anyone  in the Iron Empires can operate such  a vehicle if need be, the Driving skill is  used for pursuit, escape and in tests  involving time and travel.

They  possess  the  knowledge  of  the  myriad factors used in designing and  constructing complex structures. This  skill can be used to build structures  in the game. It can be used as a job to  replenish lost Resources. It can also  be used in the Conserve maneuver  when the player is assigned to build  infrastructure for his side during the  usurpation phase. Practice Cycle: 6 ms. Hrs/day: 2r/4d/8c Technology: Yes.

The primary  use of this skill is to recover taxed  Resources dice. It may also be used  in the Pin and Conserve maneuvers  when  the  estate  in  question  is  forefront in the action. Practice Cycle: 3 ms. Hrs/day: 3r/6d/12c Technology: No. etiquette  Wil/Per Etiquette is proper courtly behavior.

When entering a noble  or imperial court, a player whose  character is of a higher rank in the  court may challenge the etiquette of  another petitioner. Make a versus test  between the two characters\u2019 skills.  The winner gains a +1D advantage  to his next test at court and gains the  loser\u2019s margin of failure as a bonus  to his body of argument in a Duel of  Wits with his rival.  Practice Cycle: 1 ms.

Second, Torture  is the only valid dueling skill for this  conflict. Without it, the victim may  use his Will as his dueling skill and the  standard mechanics for Avoid, Incite  and Obfuscate. He may not Dismiss  with Intimidate. The victim tests his  Will and counts half his successes  for the body of argument. Add these  to his Will exponent to generate his  body of argument. Third, the stakes  for the duel cannot involve truthful  information. They must involve the  application of a trait. The torturer  may apply Maimed, Broken, Blind,  Disfigured, Sickly or any other similar  trait to his victim. The victim may set  his stakes to apply a character trait  to  himself.  Compromises  change  the severity or nature of the traits.  During the duel, the players should  describe their actions and reactions  to one another, rather than focusing  on what is said.
