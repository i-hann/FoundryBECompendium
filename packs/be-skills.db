Second, Torture\nis the only valid dueling skill for this\nconflict. Without it, the victim may\nuse his Will as his dueling skill and the\nstandard mechanics for Avoid, Incite\nand Obfuscate. He may not Dismiss\nwith Intimidate. The victim tests his\nWill and counts half his successes\nfor the body of argument. Add these\nto his Will exponent to generate his\nbody of argument. Third, the stakes\nfor the duel cannot involve truthful\ninformation. They must involve the\napplication of a trait. The torturer\nmay apply Maimed, Broken, Blind,\nDisfigured, Sickly or any other similar\ntrait to his victim. The victim may set\nhis stakes to apply a character trait\nto  himself.
