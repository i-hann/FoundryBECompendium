This compendium allows for the use of lifepaths, traits, and skills from the Burning Empires tabletop rpg published by the BWHQ: (https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-empires-pdf/). It's designed to work with the unofficial Burning Wheel system in FoundryVTT created by **Stas Tserkovny**: https://github.com/StasTserk/foundry-burningwheel. I am not associated with either StasTserk or the BWHQ

In the character burner, drag-and-drop Burning Empires lifepaths, skills, and traits directly onto your character sheet. Since this compendium does not modify the Burning Wheel FoundryVTT system, you will have to recalculate your Resources, Circles, and other statistics that differ between the Burning Wheel and Burning Empires rulesets.
